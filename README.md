# 🧠 BrainSight AI — Intelligent Brain Abnormality Heatmap Analyzer

**BrainSight AI** is a smart, interactive medical-AI application that analyzes a single CT/MRI brain slice and generates **six clinically-inspired abnormality heatmaps**—including tumor, lesion, atrophy, hemorrhage, and volumetric activation patterns. Designed with a clean UI and built on Flask, it provides a fast, intuitive way to visualize potential abnormalities with **automatic probability scoring.**

This project demonstrates full-stack AI engineering:

* medical imaging preprocessing
* heatmap generation
* probability scoring
* interactive web inference
* clean visualization optimized for clinicians & researchers

Built to be both **practical** and **portfolio-ready**, BrainSight AI showcases strong skills in **computer vision, AI product engineering, data visualization, and web development**—ideal for ML Engineer, AI Research Engineer, and Computer Vision roles.
